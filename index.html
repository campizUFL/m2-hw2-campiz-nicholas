    <h2>My Interests & Hobbies</h2>

<h2>My Career Goals</h2>

<p>I want to continue to grow within mapping, data visualization, and information management. I would like to return to international organizations and helping tell the stories they see through improving their monitoring and reporting capabilities through improved use of technology, everything from better use of databases, visualizations, and monitoring technologies like drones and sensors.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVC_vx0T0f4&t">This video</a> is an example of the technical monitoring work I assisted in setting up and running in previous job, and I am currently building my skills to return to this line of work.</p>
